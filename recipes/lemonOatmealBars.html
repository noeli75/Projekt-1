    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until combined. Mix flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture and mix until combined. Press half of the oat mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>While crust is baking, mix condensed milk, lemon juice, lemon extract, and almond extract in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour lemon mixture over the baked crust and spread evenly. Top with remaining oat mixture and gently pat into lemon mixture.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until filling has set and top crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Place in the refrigerator until chilled, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
