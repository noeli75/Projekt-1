        <li>2 cups whipping cream</li>

        <li>12 chocolate covered espresso beans</li>
      </ul> 
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Pour boiling water into a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon instant espresso coffee powder until dissolved. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature, 30 minutes. When cool, add 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur. You will use this mixture to soak ladyfingers for the filling.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, for the filling beat mascarpone and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium until smooth. Beat in powdered sugar, remaining 1 tablespoon instant espresso coffee powder, and salt until well combined. Beat in vanilla and remaining 4 tablespoons coffee liqueur. Cover bowl, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>For crust, combine 12 ladyfingers, almonds, and white sugar in a food processor. Pulse to fine crumbs. Remove mixture from food processor. Stir in butter until mixture is moistened.</li>
        <li>Pat crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan in the freezer until set, 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Beat cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer until it forms stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Stir one fourth of the whipped cream into the filling mixture to lighten. Fold remaining whipped cream into the filling mixture until combined.</li> 
        <li>Spread half of the filling over the crust.</li>
        <li>Dip remaining 12 ladyfingers, one at a time, into coffee mixture to coat, about 1 second. They will soften quickly and break easily. Place atop the filling, breaking to fit as needed. Spread remaining filling evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over top of the cheesecake. Loosen sides of pan with a thin spatula. Remove sides of pan.</li>
        <li>Garnish each slice with a chocolate covered espresso bean.</li>
    </ol>
