    <h2>Description: </h2>
      <p><strong>Pasta Alla Caponata</strong> turns a famously delicious Sicilian vegetable relish, caponata, into a fabulously delicious pasta sauce. With eggplant, capers, and pine nuts in a rich tomato sauce, this pasta dish is incredible. If you have leftovers—and you probably won't—it makes a great cold summer pasta salad, too, with just an added splash of olive oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) eggplants</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces mezze rigatoni, or other dry short pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 rib celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>8 basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese</li>
      </ul> 
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel off half the eggplant skin in strips using a peeler, and cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Add eggplant cubes to a large bowl and sprinkle over 1 tablespoon kosher salt; toss thoroughly. Let sit for 20 minutes on the counter, tossing occasionally. Transfer into a strainer, rinse lightly with cold water, and drain very well.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Add garlic cloves; when they start to sizzle, swirl the oil for about 30 seconds. Remove garlic and set aside. </li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high, and add eggplant to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until eggplant loses its firmness and just starts to become tender, about 6 minutes. Turn off the heat. Set a strainer over a bowl; transfer eggplant into the strainer. Pour any olive oil that drains into the bowl back into the skillet, and place skillet back over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Add onions, celery, and peppers to the skillet, and cook and stir for a few minutes until onions are translucent, and vegetables begin to soften. Add pinenuts, red pepper flakes, capers, and reserved garlic cloves, and cook and stir for 1 minute more. </li>
        <li>Stir in sugar and vinegar; cook, stirring for another minute. Add eggplant back into the skillet; cook and stir until eggplant is almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and a small splash of water, and cook, stirring for about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked pasta with a strainer into the finished sauce. Add a ladle or 2 of pasta water as needed to thin the sauce. Turn off the heat, and stir in torn basil leaves. Grate a small amount of pecorino on top to serve.</li> 
      </ol>
